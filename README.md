# ðŸ“ˆ Portfolio Optimization with Risk Management  

This project demonstrates **portfolio construction and risk management** using advanced techniques in quantitative finance. The framework fetches stock market data, analyzes risk-return trade-offs, optimizes portfolio weights, runs Monte Carlo simulations, and provides interactive visualizations for decision-making.

## ðŸš€ Problem Statement  
Investors often face the challenge of constructing a portfolio that maximizes returns while minimizing risks. Traditional approaches may not account for real-world constraints such as diversification, stress testing, or downside risk exposure.  

This project solves the problem by applying **modern portfolio theory** (Markowitz Optimization) combined with **risk management techniques** such as Value-at-Risk (VaR), Conditional VaR (CVaR), Monte Carlo simulations, and stress testing.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Concepts Used  
- **Markowitz Mean-Variance Optimization** â€“ finding the optimal portfolio allocation.  
- **Efficient Frontier** â€“ set of portfolios offering the best return-risk trade-off.  
- **Monte Carlo Simulations** â€“ simulating thousands of possible future portfolio paths.  
- **Risk Metrics** â€“ Value-at-Risk (VaR), Conditional VaR (CVaR), Maximum Drawdown.  
- **Stress Testing** â€“ evaluating portfolio resilience under adverse market conditions.  
- **Data Visualization** â€“ plotting efficient frontier, portfolio allocations, and return distributions.
